# NestJS Practice Project - a Chat App with Websockets (Socket.io)

## Description

- This is a [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) practive project I've done based on the [course by Michael Guay](https://youtu.be/7xpLYk4q0Sg) from Youtube with bug fixes in regards to socket.io client version and compability (and also some CORS issues).

- This Project consists in a [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) backend at `nest-socket-backend` and a simple HTML Front-end at `socket-client`.

- The backend is running `@nestjs/websockets` and `@nestjs/platform-socket.io` and `@types/socket.io` is saved as `devDependencies`.
